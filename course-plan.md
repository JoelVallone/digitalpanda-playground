    https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data?specialization=scala
    4w, 7 h/w, 80 usd
    dive into spark, its architecture and usage + good theroy and exercice combination
    => Do it and then give feedback to Fred. ?

Scala: 8w
 - functional-program-design-in-scala 4.4/2481, EPFL
    https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2?specialization=scala
    4w, 8h/w, 80 usd
    might already know a bit the content, but provides good paractical exercices

# On hold
ML theory: 23w
 -  2) Machine learning, Columbia university
    https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning
    12w, 9 h/w, advanced, 300 usd
    Mathematical view on all common ML algorihtms
    Might be redundant with course taken wih Andrew-Ng but seems quite richfor a solid background
    No Neural Networks...
 
 - Sequence Models (with neural net), 4.8/11'698, Andrew-Ng
    https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models

    Good course content +  use of Keras Lib, weak exercices
    
 - Convolutional Neural Networks, 4.8/18'424
    4w, 5 h/w, intermediate, 80 usd
    Good overview over CNN techniques, uses TensorFlow & Keras libraries (hard if first time)
    
 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning, 4.9/46'425
    https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning
    4w, 5 h/w, intermediate, 80 usd
    Good overview over neural networks (already did that...), does not use libraries, easy
    
ML paractical: 2w

    https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects
    2w, 4 h/w, beginner, 40 usd
    a bit repetitive when compared to previous courses
    => Ask eduard if course can be taken idependently
    => See if Fred. can do it first then get feedback ?
